After reviewing your uploaded SQL files, here is a summary and evaluation of your work:

---

### **Feedback**

1. **Database Creation (01.create-db-school.sql)**:

   - You successfully created the database.
   - Everything is clear and follows a logical structure.

2. **Students Table (02.create-table-students.sql)**:

   - The design is straightforward and includes relevant fields (e.g., `StudentID`, `FirstName`, `LastName`).
   - Good use of `PRIMARY KEY`.

3. **Courses Table (03.create-table-courses.sql)**:

   - The table structure is well-defined.
   - `CourseID` as a primary key is appropriate, and your choice of additional columns aligns with best practices.

4. **Enrollments Table (04.create-table-enrollments.sql)**:

   - Well-structured for a many-to-many relationship between students and courses.
   - Proper use of foreign keys (`StudentID` and `CourseID`) to enforce referential integrity.

5. **Data Insertion (05-07.insert-data-\*.sql)**:

   - You inserted meaningful data for students, courses, and enrollments.
   - Data is diverse enough to support various queries for testing purposes.

6. **Queries (08-09.query-\*.sql)**:
   - Queries are relevant and demonstrate the ability to retrieve and filter data.
   - You've included both specific queries and more general ones, which show a good understanding of SQL capabilities.

### **Grade**: **A**

You demonstrated an excellent grasp of concepts like table design, relationships, and query writing. Your work is well-organized and complete.

### **Next Steps**

- **Validation**: Add constraints to ensure data consistency (e.g., `CHECK` for valid dates or non-negative values).
- **Advanced Queries**: Write more complex queries, such as:
  - Aggregating data (e.g., total students enrolled in each course).
  - Using `JOIN` with filtering conditions.
- **Indexes**: Add indexes on frequently queried columns for optimization.
- **Error Handling**: Include examples of handling duplicate data with `ON CONFLICT` or ensuring unique values.
