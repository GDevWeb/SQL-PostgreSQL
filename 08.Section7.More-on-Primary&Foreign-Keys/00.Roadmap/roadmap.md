Thank you for sharing the outline! The next section seems concise but focused on a critical topic: **Primary and Foreign Keys**, especially composite and self-referencing keys. Here's a suggested approach for tackling it efficiently:

---

### **Overview of Section 7**

- **Focus Areas**:
  1. Composite Keys (Primary and Foreign).
  2. Self-Referencing Relationships.
  3. Real-world applications and practical scenarios.

---

### **Suggested Plan**

1. **Start with Videos for New Concepts**:

   - Watch **130 (Composite Primary Keys)** and **132 (Composite Foreign Keys)** carefully since these concepts are likely new.
   - Skim through shorter videos like **128 (Auto-Incrementing IDs)** and **129 (When to Use Which Column)** to reinforce existing knowledge.

2. **Pause for Hands-On Practice**:

   - After learning about composite keys, try building:
     - A **many-to-many relationship** table using composite primary keys.
     - A self-referencing table to represent hierarchical data (e.g., employees and managers).

3. **Simulate Real-World Scenarios**:
   - Use the concepts from your project (e.g., reporting activities) and add composite keys where relevant.
   - Try designing tables that might involve **self-referencing relationships**.

### **Time Commitment**

- **Total Videos**: ~41 minutes.
- **Hands-On Practice**: 1â€“2 hours (spread over sessions).
