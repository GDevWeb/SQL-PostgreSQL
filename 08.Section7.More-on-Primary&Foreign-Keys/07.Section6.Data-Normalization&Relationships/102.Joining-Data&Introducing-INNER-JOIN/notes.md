### **Objective**

This module focuses on **joining tables** to retrieve data across related tables using **INNER JOIN**.

---

### **What You'll Learn**

- The concept of **JOIN** in SQL.
- How to combine rows from two or more tables.
- Use **INNER JOIN** to match records in related tables.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è **Step 1: Setting the Stage**

We'll work with these tables:

1. **Customers**: Contains customer details.
2. **Products**: Lists available products.
3. **Orders**: Tracks orders made by customers.
4. **OrderDetails**: Tracks which products are in which orders and their quantities.

---

### üß© **Practice Tasks**

#### **Task 1: Basic INNER JOIN**

- Write a query to retrieve all orders, including:
  - The customer's name.
  - The order date.

#### **Task 2: Joining Multiple Tables**

- Extend the query to include:
  - The product name.
  - The quantity ordered.
  - The total price (calculated dynamically).

#### **Task 3: Filter Joined Data**

- Add a filter to retrieve only orders placed by a specific customer (e.g., "Alice Smith").

---

### **How to Proceed**

1. Start by writing basic JOIN queries.
2. Incrementally add more complexity to the queries (multiple tables, filters, and calculated fields).
