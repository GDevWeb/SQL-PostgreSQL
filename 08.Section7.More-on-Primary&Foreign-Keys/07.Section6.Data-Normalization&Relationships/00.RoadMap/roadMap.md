# Section 6 : Data Normalization & Relationships: Splitting & Joining Data

## Recommended Roadmap for This Section:

### **Day 1: Foundations & Concepts**

- **Start with the first four modules to understand the basics:**

  1. **94. Module Introduction**: Brief overview of the section.
  2. **95. A First Look at Related Data**: Understand why relationships between tables matter.
  3. **96. Data Normalization - First Steps**: Learn the importance of organizing data.
  4. **97. Splitting Data Into Tables**: Practice breaking data into logical tables.

  **Goal**: Build a solid understanding of normalization and related data concepts. Take notes on terms like 1NF, 2NF, 3NF.

#### **Day 2: Practical Implementation of Normalization**

- **Progress with the next set of modules:**

  1. **98. Forms Of Data Normalization**: Dive deeper into forms of normalization.
  2. **99. Our First Section Example**: Follow the course's example on normalized tables.
  3. **100. Creating Tables With Relations**: Create tables that demonstrate normalized relationships.
  4. **101. Inserting Related Data**: Learn how to input data into related tables.

  **Goal**: Practice creating normalized tables and inserting data. You can design a small use case for better understanding.

#### **Day 3: Mastering `JOIN` Queries**

- **Move to the modules about joins:**

  1. **102. Joining Data & Introducing INNER JOIN**: Understand `INNER JOIN`.
  2. **103. Using INNER JOIN**: Write basic `INNER JOIN` queries.
  3. **104. Combining Multiple JOINs**: Learn to combine joins across multiple tables.
  4. **105. Data Joining & Filtering**: Practice filtering with joins.

  **Goal**: Practice `JOIN` queries on tables with realistic data, combining concepts of normalization and relationships.

---

#### **Day 4: Deep Dive Into Different Joins**

- **Focus on LEFT and RIGHT JOINs:**

  1. **106. Introducing LEFT JOIN**: Learn how to include unmatched rows.
  2. **107. Using LEFT JOIN**: Write queries with `LEFT JOIN`.
  3. **108. Combining Multiple LEFT JOINs**: Practice complex queries with `LEFT JOIN`.
  4. **109. What About RIGHT JOIN?**: Understand the difference between `LEFT JOIN` and `RIGHT JOIN`.

  **Goal**: Explore different types of joins and write practice queries to compare results.

---

#### **Day 5: Advanced Relationships and Constraints**

- **Cover foreign keys and many-to-many relationships:**

  1. **113-115. Foreign Key Constraints**: Learn to define and use foreign keys effectively.
  2. **119. Data Relationship Types**: Understand one-to-many, many-to-many, and one-to-one relationships.
  3. **123. Many-to-Many Relationships & Intermediate Tables**: Learn how to implement and query many-to-many relationships.

  **Goal**: Practice creating foreign key constraints and work with intermediate tables for many-to-many relationships.

---

#### **Day 6: Apply Everything in a Project**

- **Design a mini-project:**

  - Create a database for a scenario (e.g., library, online shop, or student-course management).
  - Define normalized tables.
  - Create relationships with foreign keys.
  - Insert data and write `JOIN` queries.

  **Goal**: Apply normalization, relationships, joins, and constraints to build a fully functional relational database.
