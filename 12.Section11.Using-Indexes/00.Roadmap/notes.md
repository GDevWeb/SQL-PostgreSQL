   - Understand the goals of the section and the importance of indexing.

2. **175: What Are Indexes? And Why Would You Need Them?** _(10 minutes)_

   - Learn the purpose of indexes and how they can improve query performance.

3. **176: Don't Use Too Many Indexes!** _(7 minutes)_

   - Understand the trade-offs of over-indexing, including maintenance and storage concerns.

4. **177: Index Types: An Overview** _(10 minutes)_
   - Learn about the different types of indexes (e.g., single-column, composite, partial).

**Practice:**

#### **Day 2: Applying Indexes**

**Focus: Lessons 178 to 180**

1. **178: Setting Up Some Example Data** _(5 minutes)_

   - Create a dataset for testing and practicing indexing.

2. **179: EXPLAINing Queries & Query Planning** _(15 minutes)_

3. **180: Creating & Using Single-Column Indexes** _(10 minutes)_
   - Learn how to create and use single-column indexes effectively.

**Practice:**

- Use `EXPLAIN` to analyze query performance before and after adding single-column indexes.

#### **Day 3: Advanced Indexing Techniques**

**Focus: Lessons 181 to 184**

1. **181: More on Creating & Dropping Indexes** _(5 minutes)_

   - Learn about managing indexes, including creating and dropping them.

2. **182: Unique Indexes** _(5 minutes)_

   - Understand how unique indexes enforce data uniqueness in columns.

3. **183: Working With Multi-Column Indexes (Composite Indexes)** _(15 minutes)_

   - Learn how to create and use composite indexes for multi-column queries.

4. **184: Partial Indexes** _(10 minutes)_
   - Explore partial indexes and their use cases for filtering specific rows.

**Practice:**

- Create composite and partial indexes to optimize complex queries.

### **Wrap-Up and Project Work**

#### **Day 4: Review & Application**

1. **Review Key Lessons**:

   - Summarize what you’ve learned about indexes.
   - Practice creating and managing indexes with varying query patterns.

2. **Module Project:**

   - Apply indexing concepts to optimize queries for a sample project database.
   - Use `EXPLAIN` to analyze the performance improvement from indexing.

3. **Reflect:**
   - Write a brief summary of the section, highlighting key takeaways and real-world applications.
