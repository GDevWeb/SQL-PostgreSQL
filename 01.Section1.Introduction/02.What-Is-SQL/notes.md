# **2. What Is SQL?**

## **Definition of SQL**

- [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/sql-the-complete-developers-guide-mysql-postgresql/learn/lecture/28614062#overview)

**SQL (Structured Query Language)** is a standard programming language designed for managing and manipulating relational databases. It allows developers to:

- **Store** data in structured formats.
- **Retrieve** data efficiently using queries.
- **Update** data when needed.
- **Delete** or reorganize data.

### **Key Features of SQL**

1. **Declarative Language**:

   - You specify **what** you want (e.g., "Get all customers") rather than **how** to get it.
   - This makes SQL user-friendly compared to procedural programming languages.

2. **Relational Database Focus**:

   - SQL operates on **relational databases**, which organize data into tables with rows and columns.

3. **Standardized**:

   - SQL follows standards (e.g., ANSI SQL) but has slight variations across database systems like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle.

4. **Powerful Operations**:
   - SQL supports operations for:
     - Querying data (`SELECT`).
     - Modifying data (`INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`).
     - Creating database structures (`CREATE TABLE`, `ALTER TABLE`).
     - Controlling access (`GRANT`, `REVOKE`).

#### **Why SQL is Important**

1. **Data-Centric World**:
   - Most modern applications, from web apps to machine learning models, rely on databases for managing data.
2. **Widely Used**:
   - SQL is used in countless systems, including **e-commerce**, **banking**, and **social media platforms**.
3. **Interoperability**:

   - SQL knowledge is transferable between different database systems (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.).

4. **Career Relevance**:
   - SQL is consistently listed as a top skill for tech jobs such as **data analysts**, **backend developers**, and **database administrators**.

#### **Basic SQL Syntax Example**

A simple query to retrieve all records from a table called `Customers`:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Customers;
```

What this does:

- `SELECT`: Specifies the data to retrieve.
- `*`: Retrieves all columns.
- `FROM Customers`: Specifies the table from which to retrieve data.
