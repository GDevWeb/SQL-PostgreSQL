### **Summary of Section 10: Database Transactions**

---

### **Key Concepts**

1. **What is a Transaction?**
   - A transaction is a sequence of SQL operations executed as a single logical unit of work.
   - Ensures **ACID properties**:
     - **Atomicity**: All operations succeed or fail as a unit.
     - **Consistency**: Database remains valid before and after the transaction.
     - **Isolation**: Concurrent transactions do not interfere with each other.
     - **Durability**: Changes are permanent once committed.

### **Core SQL Commands for Transactions**

| **Command**                        | **Purpose**                                                                    |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `BEGIN`                            | Starts a transaction block.                                                    |
| `COMMIT`                           | Saves all changes made in the current transaction to the database.             |
| `ROLLBACK`                         | Undoes all changes made in the current transaction.                            |
| `SAVEPOINT savepoint_name`         | Sets a checkpoint within the transaction.                                      |
| `ROLLBACK TO savepoint_name`       | Rolls back changes to a specific savepoint without undoing earlier operations. |
| `RELEASE SAVEPOINT savepoint_name` | Removes a savepoint, making it unavailable for rollback.                       |
| `SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL`  | Configures transaction behavior for concurrency control.                       |

### **PostgreSQL-Specific Features**

1. **Isolation Levels**:

   - **READ UNCOMMITTED**: Allows dirty reads (rarely used in PostgreSQL).
   - **READ COMMITTED**: Default level, reads only committed data.
   - **REPEATABLE READ**: Ensures consistent reads during the transaction.
   - **SERIALIZABLE**: Most strict, ensures full isolation.

2. **Error Handling**:

   - Use `ROLLBACK` or `ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT` to handle errors without aborting the entire transaction.

3. **Nested Transactions**:
   - Simulate nested transactions using multiple `SAVEPOINTS`.

---

### **Practical Applications**

1. **Data Integrity**:

   - Example: Ensuring a customer order and its associated items are either fully processed or fully discarded.

2. **Error Recovery**:

   - Example: If a constraint violation occurs during a batch update, roll back the changes to prevent partial updates.

3. **Complex Updates**:

   - Example: Apply multiple updates with checkpoints to allow partial rollbacks if necessary.

4. **Concurrency Control**:
   - Example: Use isolation levels to manage data consistency in high-concurrency environments.

---

### **Exercises Recap**

1. **Basic Transactions**:

   - Practiced `BEGIN`, `COMMIT`, and `ROLLBACK` for simple operations.

2. **Savepoints**:

   - Used `SAVEPOINT` to create checkpoints and rolled back specific parts of a transaction.

3. **PostgreSQL Features**:
   - Worked with isolation levels to control transaction behavior.

### **Key Takeaways**

- **Transactions are critical** for maintaining database integrity, especially in multi-step operations.
- **Savepoints provide flexibility** to handle errors in complex transactions.
- **Isolation levels ensure data consistency** in concurrent environments.
