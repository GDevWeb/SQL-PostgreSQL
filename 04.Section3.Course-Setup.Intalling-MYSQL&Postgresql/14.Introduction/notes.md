### **What You'll Learn**

In this section, you'll set up your local environment to practice SQL by installing two popular database systems:

1. **MySQL**: A widely-used open-source relational database management system.
2. **PostgreSQL**: A powerful, open-source relational database system known for its advanced features and standards compliance.

#### **Why Use Both MySQL and PostgreSQL?**

- **MySQL**: Easy to use and commonly used in web development projects (e.g., WordPress, e-commerce platforms).
- **PostgreSQL**: Known for its flexibility and support for advanced features like JSON data types, window functions, and complex queries.

Learning both helps you:

1. Gain a broader understanding of relational database systems.
2. Choose the right tool for different projects.
3. Be versatile in different work environments and job requirements.
