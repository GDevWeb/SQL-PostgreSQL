   - Learn the theoretical foundation of aggregate functions.

4. **139. Understanding COUNT()** (11 min)

   - Practice counting rows in tables.
   - **Task**: Write a query to count:
     - All rows in a table.
     - Rows that meet specific conditions.

5. **140. Working with MIN(), MAX(), and Aliases** (8 min)

1. **141. Using SUM(), AVG() & ROUND()** (8 min)

   - Practice summing, averaging, and rounding numeric values.

2. **142. Working with Filters & Joining Tables** (12 min)

   - Understand how to combine aggregate functions with `WHERE` clauses.
   - Practice using joins alongside aggregates.

3. **143. Theory Time - Understanding GROUP BY** (5 min)

   - Learn the concept and syntax of `GROUP BY`.

### **Thursday**: 2 Hours

**Goal**: Advanced Grouping & Filtering

1. **145. GROUP BY & Joined Queries** (6 min)

   - Learn to use `GROUP BY` with joined tables.

2. **146. Understanding WHERE vs HAVING** (10 min)

   - Understand the difference between filtering rows (`WHERE`) and groups (`HAVING`).

3. **147. Applying HAVING in Practice** (7 min)

   - Practice filtering groups with `HAVING`.

4. **148. Working with Nested Subqueries** (11 min)
   - Practice creating subqueries for advanced filtering and calculations.

---

### **Friday**: 2 Hours

**Goal**: Advanced Concepts & Summary

1. **149. Introducing Window Functions** (8 min)

   - Learn the basics of window functions and how they differ from aggregate functions.

2. **150. Understanding ORDER BY and RANK()** (7 min)

   - Practice ordering results and using `RANK()` to rank rows within groups.

3. Review the module project and practice writing combined queries:

   - Use aggregate functions, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, and joins to solve complex scenarios.

4. Summarize key concepts and make notes for revision.

### **Key Tips**:

- **Focus on Practice**: After watching each video, spend time replicating the queries and scenarios in your SQL environment.
- **Revisit Concepts**: Use Tuesday and Wednesday to focus on basics; revisit `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, and `JOIN` if they’re unclear.
- **Create Realistic Examples**: Use a mock dataset (e.g., sales, employees, or customers) to replicate queries in the module.
