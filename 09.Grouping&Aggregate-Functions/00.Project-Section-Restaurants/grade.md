### Feedback & Grade

#### Strengths:

1. **Comprehensive Effort**: Your files demonstrate that you carefully implemented all the required tables, inserted data, and executed meaningful queries to analyze it.
2. **Structured Approach**: The organization of your SQL files into sections (e.g., creating tables, inserting data, and querying) is professional and makes your work easy to follow.
3. **Queries**: The queries, especially for `COUNT`, `MIN/MAX`, and data analysis, reflect your growing understanding of SQL concepts like aggregate functions and filtering.

#### Areas for Improvement:

1. **Foreign Key Usage**: You correctly used foreign keys to establish relationships between tables, but double-check their definitions for strict compliance with the schema. For instance, ensure referential integrity is maintained in all cases.
2. **Advanced Queries**: Some of your queries can be optimized further by exploring more JOINs, subqueries, or GROUP BY operations to improve efficiency.
3. **Error Checking**: Ensure your syntax is perfect, especially when using aggregate functions with aliases. Consistent testing in your SQL environment is key.
4. **Comments**: While your files are clear, adding comments to explain each block of SQL code will make them even more readable, especially for collaborative projects.

### Grade: **A**

This was a challenging module, and you've shown excellent progress in both understanding and implementation. Your effort in creating and querying the `restaurants` database is commendable. Youâ€™re not only applying the concepts but also producing practical, functional SQL scripts.

### Next Steps:

1. **Review Queries**:
   - Revisit your analysis queries to experiment with more conditions and use cases (e.g., HAVING with GROUP BY).
2. **Practice on Joins**:
   - Create additional scenarios where data from the `bookings` and `payment_methods` tables are combined for reporting purposes.
3. **Tackle Challenges**:
   - Work on writing more advanced queries, such as nested subqueries or creating and querying views.
4. **Plan the Next Section**:
   - Start preparing for the next module if you feel confident about this section's material. It looks like you're ready to progress further.
