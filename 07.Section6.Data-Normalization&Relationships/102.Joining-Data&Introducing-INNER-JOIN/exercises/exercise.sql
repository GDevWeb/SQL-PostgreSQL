/* 
### ðŸ§© **Practice Tasks**

#### **Task 1: Basic INNER JOIN**

- Write a query to retrieve all orders, including:
  - The customer's name.
  - The order date.


#### **Task 2: Joining Multiple Tables**

- Extend the query to include:
  - The product name.
  - The quantity ordered.
  - The total price (calculated dynamically).

#### **Task 3: Filter Joined Data**
- Add a filter to retrieve only orders placed by a specific customer (e.g., "Alice Smith").
