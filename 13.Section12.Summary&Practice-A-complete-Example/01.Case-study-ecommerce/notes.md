For this section, I propose simulating the **"E-Commerce Order Management System"** as the case study. This project aligns with real-world scenarios, covers diverse SQL concepts, and provides ample opportunity to practice queries on a relational database.

### **Case Study: E-Commerce Order Management System**

#### **Project Goal:**

Develop a database to manage an e-commerce platform’s orders, products, customers, and payments. The database will track customer orders, product inventory, payment status, and delivery information.

---

### **Tables & Relationships**

1. **Customers Table**:

   - Stores customer details.
   - **Columns**: `CustomerID`, `FirstName`, `LastName`, `Email`, `PhoneNumber`, `Address`.

2. **Products Table**:

   - Contains details of available products.
   - **Columns**: `ProductID`, `ProductName`, `Category`, `Price`, `Quantity`, `Stock`, `CreatedAt`, `UpdatedAt`

3. **Orders Table**:

   - Tracks orders made by customers.
   - **Columns**: `OrderID`, `CustomerID (FK)`, `OrderDate`, `OrderStatus`.

4. **OrderDetails Table**:

   - Links products to specific orders.
   - **Columns**: `OrderDetailID`, `OrderID (FK)`, `ProductID (FK)`, `Quantity`, `TotalPrice`.

5. **Payments Table**:

   - Tracks payment status and details.
   - **Columns**: `PaymentID`, `OrderID (FK)`, `PaymentDate`, `PaymentMethod`, `PaymentAmount`, `PaymentStatus`.

6. **Shipping Table**:
   - Tracks delivery/shipping details.
   - **Columns**: `ShippingID`, `OrderID (FK)`, `ShippingDate`, `ShippingMethod`, `ShippingStatus`.

### **Key Features to Implement**

- **Normalization**: Ensure data is stored in normalized form to reduce redundancy.
- **Relationships**: Establish `one-to-many` and `many-to-many` relationships between entities.
- **Keys**:
  - Use `Primary Keys` for unique identification.
  - Use `Foreign Keys` to enforce relationships.
- **Constraints**:
  - `CHECK` constraints for valid data entry.
  - `DEFAULT` values for some columns (e.g., `OrderStatus` as `Pending`).

---

### **SQL Queries to Practice**

- **Basic Queries**:

  - Retrieve all customer orders.
  - Find products with low stock levels (`Quantity < 50`).
  - Calculate total revenue from all orders.

- **Aggregations**:

  - Find the top 5 best-selling products.
  - Calculate the total number of orders per customer.
  - Determine monthly revenue trends.

- **Joins**:

  - List all orders along with customer names and products ordered.
  - Retrieve shipping details for FulFilled orders.

- **Advanced Filtering**:

  - List all orders placed in the last 30 days.
  - Find orders where payments are pending.

- **Nested Queries**:
  - Find customers who have never placed an order.
  - List products not yet ordered by any customer.

### **Why This Case?**

- It’s **realistic and professional**, reflecting common use cases in SQL development.
- It leverages **relational database concepts** such as joins, subqueries, and constraints.
- It offers a clear **progression from basic queries to advanced operations** like aggregations and filtering.

Would you like me to start detailing the database design and queries for this case?
