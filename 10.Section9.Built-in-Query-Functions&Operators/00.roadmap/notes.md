    - 155. Using String Functions with INSERT (9 min)
  - üü¢ Practice:
    - Use mathematical functions to calculate totals, discounts, or averages.
    - Use string functions (`UPPER`, `LOWER`, `CONCAT`) on `Members` or `Membership Types`.

---

#### **Day 3: Friday**

**Goal**: Understand and apply date/time functions.

- **Tasks**:
  - üü¢ Watch videos:

    - 158. Calculating INTERVALS (10 min)
    - 159. Adding INTERVALS to Dates (8 min)
  - üü¢ Practice:
    - Work on the `Membership Start` and `Membership End` dates:
      - Calculate the duration of memberships using date differences.
      - Add intervals to extend membership periods.

---

#### **Day 4: Sunday**

**Goal**: Dive deeper into filtering and subqueries.

- **Tasks**:
  - üü¢ Watch videos:
    - 160. Understanding LIKE & Pattern Matching (10 min)
    - 161. Understanding EXISTS (6 min)
    - 162. Working with Subquery Expressions and EXISTS (4 min)
    - 163. Working with Subquery Expressions and IN (8 min)
  - üü¢ Practice:
    - Write queries using `LIKE` to find members by patterns in names.
    - Use `EXISTS` and subqueries to filter data:
      - E.g., Find members who have checked in more than 5 times.

---

#### **Day 5: Next Week**

**Goal**: Complete and finalize the section.

- **Tasks**:
  - üü¢ Watch videos:
    - 164. Introducing Conditional Expressions (7 min)
    - 165. Challenge Solution (7 min)
    - 166. Database (SQL) vs Application Level (3 min)
  - üü¢ Practice:
    - Use conditional expressions like `CASE` to label membership types (e.g., "Gold", "Silver").
    - Compare SQL queries and calculations with potential application-side processing.

---

#### **General Notes**

1. ‚è± **Pace Yourself**: Watch videos in chunks and prioritize applying concepts immediately in SQL.
2. üìö **Practice Regularly**: Ensure each day ends with a mix of theory and practice.
3. ‚ùì **Ask Questions**: Share any doubts after practicing each set of queries.
4. üíæ **Save Work**: Continuously document your SQL scripts to review later.

Let me know if you need further adjustments or additional details for any day!

### Details to Create the Gym Club Membership Management System Database

The Gym Club Membership Management System database will involve three primary entities:

---

### **1. Members Table**

Tracks individual members of the gym.

- **Columns**:
  - `MemberID` (Primary Key, Serial): Unique identifier for each member.
  - `FirstName` (VARCHAR(50), NOT NULL): Member's first name.
  - `LastName` (VARCHAR(50), NOT NULL): Member's last name.
  - `Gender` (ENUM: 'Male', 'Female', 'Non-Binary', 'Other', 'N/A'): Gender of the member.
  - `DateOfBirth` (DATE): Member's date of birth.
  - `Email` (VARCHAR(100), UNIQUE, NOT NULL): Member's email address.
  - `PhoneNumber` (VARCHAR(15), UNIQUE): Member's phone number.
  - `JoinDate` (DATE, DEFAULT CURRENT_DATE): Date when the member joined.
  - `MembershipID` (Foreign Key): Links to the Membership Types table.

---

### **2. Membership Types Table**

Tracks types of gym memberships.

- **Columns**:
  - `MembershipID` (Primary Key, Serial): Unique identifier for each membership type.
  - `MembershipName` (VARCHAR(50), NOT NULL): Name of the membership (e.g., Basic, Premium, Family).
  - `Price` (DECIMAL(8,2), NOT NULL): Monthly cost of the membership.
  - `BillingFrequency` (ENUM: 'Monthly', 'Quarterly', 'Yearly'): Frequency of payment.
  - `AccessLevel` (VARCHAR(100)): Level of access provided (e.g., gym only, gym + pool, all facilities).

---

### **3. Membership Records Table**

Tracks active and past memberships for members.

- **Columns**:
  - `RecordID` (Primary Key, Serial): Unique identifier for each record.
  - `MemberID` (Foreign Key): Links to the Members table.
  - `MembershipID` (Foreign Key): Links to the Membership Types table.
  - `StartDate` (DATE, DEFAULT CURRENT_DATE): When the membership starts.
  - `EndDate` (DATE, NULLABLE): When the membership ends (null if active).

### Example SQL Script to Create Tables

If you'd like, I can draft the SQL commands to create these tables based on this schema. Let me know!
