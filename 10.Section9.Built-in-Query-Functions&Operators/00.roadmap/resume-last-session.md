### **Lessons Covered**

#### **Lesson 161: Working with Subquery Expressions and EXISTS**

- Learned how to use the `EXISTS` operator for filtering rows based on the existence of related records in a subquery.
- Explored correlated subqueries and how they reference the outer query.
- Practical applications included:
  - Members with gym check-ins.
  - Trainers assigned to members.
  - Facilities with bookings in 2024.

#### **Lesson 162: Subquery Expressions and EXISTS (Advanced)**

- Expanded on `EXISTS` with complex subqueries for more advanced filtering.
- Differentiated between correlated and uncorrelated subqueries.
- Applied `EXISTS` to scenarios like memberships expiring soon, unassigned trainers, and overlapping bookings.

#### **Lesson 163: Subquery Expressions and IN**

- Focused on the `IN` operator for filtering rows based on a list or subquery.
- Compared `IN` and `EXISTS`, highlighting when to use each.
- Examples included:
  - Members with active memberships.
  - Facilities used by specific members.
  - Membership types with active users.

### **Areas for Improvement**

1. **Optimize Subqueries**:
   - Use uncorrelated subqueries where possible for better performance.
   - Avoid unnecessary conditions in `EXISTS` clauses.
2. **Broaden Use Cases**:
   - Explore combining `EXISTS` and `IN` with `JOIN` for more complex scenarios.

### **Overall Grade**: **A-**

- Youâ€™ve shown strong progress and a solid grasp of subqueries, especially with `EXISTS` and `IN`.
- A few areas can be refined, particularly around optimizing query performance and expanding use cases.
