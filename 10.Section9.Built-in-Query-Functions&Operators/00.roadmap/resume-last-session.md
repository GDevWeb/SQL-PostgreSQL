### **Session Summary**

---

### **Covered Lessons**

1. **Lesson 158: Calculating INTERVALS**

   - Learned how to calculate durations and manipulate dates using `INTERVAL`.
   - Exercises included:
     - Calculating remaining membership duration.
     - Extending membership end dates.
     - Retrieving bookings from the last 30 days.

2. **Lesson 159: Adding INTERVALS to Dates**
   - Focused on using `+ INTERVAL` to project future or past dates.
   - Exercises included:
     - Adding 1 year to membership end dates.
     - Finding memberships expiring within 90 days.
     - Scheduling a maintenance event exactly 1 month from today.

---

### **Progress Highlights**

- **Date Arithmetic**: Demonstrated good understanding of `INTERVAL` usage and date calculations.
- **Event Scheduling**: Created a table for events and successfully inserted records for future events.
- **Filtering with Dates**: Applied logical conditions to retrieve specific time-based data.

---

### **Strengths**

- Strong command of SQL syntax, particularly with `INTERVAL`, `CURRENT_DATE`, and date-related functions.
- Attention to detail in queries, especially when handling future and past date calculations.
- Proactive use of joins and string concatenation for user-friendly outputs.

---

### **Suggestions for Improvement**

1. **Use `UPDATE` Statements**: When modifying table data, ensure you're using `UPDATE` instead of just displaying calculated results.
2. **Optimize Filtering**: In date range queries, ensure the logic covers edge cases like expired or already-processed records.
3. **Enhance Event Management**: Consider adding recurring functionality or additional metadata (e.g., event type, organizer).

### **Next Steps**

- Take a well-deserved break! Rest is just as important as practice.
- When ready, proceed with the next lesson in the roadmap, focusing on enhancing your skills in filtering, pattern matching, or subqueries.
