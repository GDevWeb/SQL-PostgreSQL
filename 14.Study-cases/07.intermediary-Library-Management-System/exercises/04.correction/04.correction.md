### **Feedback on Your Queries**

#### **1. Retrieve all books with their authors and publication years**

✅ **Strengths:**

- Correctly uses `LEFT JOIN` to link `Books`, `Authors`, and `BookAuthors` tables.
- View (`retrieve_all_books`) ensures data reusability.

🔹 **Suggestions:**

- `LEFT JOIN` works here, but `INNER JOIN` could be preferable if every book has at least one author.
- Instead of `AS`, you could use `b.publication_year AS release_year` for better readability.

---

#### **2. Find all books currently on loan (not returned yet)**

✅ **Strengths:**

- Proper `WHERE return_date IS NULL` condition to filter active loans.
- View (`books_not_yet_returned`) improves efficiency.

🔹 **Suggestions:**

- Consider indexing `return_date` to speed up the query if the dataset is large.

---

#### **3. List overdue books (past due date but not returned)**

✅ **Strengths:**

- Correctly identifies overdue books using `CURRENT_DATE`.
- Uses `LEFT JOIN` correctly.

🔹 **Suggestions:**

- If overdue books are frequently queried, creating a view for `overdue_books` may optimize performance.

---

#### **4. Find the most borrowed books**

❌ **Issue:**

- `ORDER BY l.book_id ASC` sorts by book ID instead of borrow count.
- `LIMIT 5` should be after sorting by `COUNT(l.book_id) DESC`.

✅ **Corrected Query:**

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW most_borrowed_books AS
SELECT
    b.title,
    COUNT(l.book_id) AS total_borrowed
FROM loans AS l
LEFT JOIN books AS b ON l.book_id = b.book_id
GROUP BY b.title
ORDER BY total_borrowed DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

---

#### **5. Retrieve borrower details who have overdue books**

✅ **Strengths:**

- Correctly joins `Borrowers` and `Loans`.
- `LEFT JOIN` ensures all borrowers are included.

❌ **Issue:**

- `WHERE l.due_date IS NOT NULL;` should check overdue condition: `l.due_date < CURRENT_DATE AND l.return_date IS NULL`.

✅ **Corrected Query:**

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW borrower_have_overdue_books AS
SELECT
    b.borrower_name,
    b.email,
    b.phone,
    l.due_date AS overdue_books
FROM borrowers AS b
LEFT JOIN loans AS l ON b.borrower_id = l.borrower_id
WHERE l.due_date < CURRENT_DATE AND l.return_date IS NULL;
```

---

#### **6. Count the total number of books written by each author**

✅ **Strengths:**

- Correct use of `COUNT(ba.book_id)` and `GROUP BY`.
- `HAVING COUNT(ba.book_id) > 0` correctly filters only authors with books.

🔹 **Suggestions:**

- You don’t need `HAVING COUNT(ba.book_id) > 0` since `COUNT()` always returns 0 or more.

✅ **Optimized Query:**

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW total_book_by_author AS
SELECT
    a.author_name,
    COUNT(ba.book_id) AS total_books
FROM bookauthors AS ba
LEFT JOIN authors AS a ON ba.author_id = a.author_id
GROUP BY a.author_id, a.author_name;
```

---

#### **7. Find borrowers who have borrowed more than three books**

❌ **Issue:**

- `SELECT * borrowers_more_3_books;` should be `SELECT * FROM borrowers_more_3_books;`

✅ **Corrected Query:**

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW borrowers_more_3_books AS
SELECT
    bor.borrower_name,
    COUNT(l.borrower_id) AS total_borrowed
FROM loans AS l
LEFT JOIN borrowers AS bor ON l.borrower_id = bor.borrower_id
GROUP BY bor.borrower_name, l.borrower_id
HAVING COUNT(l.borrower_id) >= 3;
```

✅ **Query to retrieve:**

```sql
SELECT * FROM borrowers_more_3_books;
```

---

#### **8. Calculate the average loan duration for returned books**

❌ **Issue:**

- `round(AVG(due_date - return_date), 0) AS avg_loan_duration` uses `due_date` instead of `loan_date`.

✅ **Corrected Query:**

```sql
SELECT
    ROUND(AVG(return_date - loan_date), 0) AS avg_loan_duration
FROM loans
WHERE return_date IS NOT NULL;
```

---

### **Overall Feedback & Grade: A-**

- ✅ **Great use of JOINs, views, and filters.**
- ❌ **Minor mistakes in sorting, filtering overdue books, and a missing `FROM` keyword.**
- 🎯 **Continue refining queries for better efficiency.**

You're improving with every study case! 🚀 Keep up the good work! 😊
