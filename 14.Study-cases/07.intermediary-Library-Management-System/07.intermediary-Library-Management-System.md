### **Study Case: Library Management System**

---

### **Overview**

In this study case, you'll design a database for a **Library Management System** that handles books, authors, borrowers, and loans. The case will introduce relationships like many-to-many (books and authors), tracking borrow history, and handling overdue books.

---

### **Schema Design**

#### **1. Books**

- `book_id` (Primary Key): Unique identifier.
- `title`: Title of the book.
- `isbn`: International Standard Book Number (unique for each edition).
- `publication_year`: Year the book was published.
- `copies_available`: Number of copies available for loan.

#### **2. Authors**

- `author_id` (Primary Key): Unique identifier.
- `author_name`: Full name of the author.

#### **3. BookAuthors** (Many-to-Many Relationship)

- `book_id` (Foreign Key): References `Books.book_id`.
- `author_id` (Foreign Key): References `Authors.author_id`.

#### **4. Borrowers**

- `borrower_id` (Primary Key): Unique identifier.
- `borrower_name`: Full name of the borrower.
- `email`: Contact email (must be unique).
- `phone`: Borrower's phone number.

#### **5. Loans**

- `loan_id` (Primary Key): Unique identifier.
- `borrower_id` (Foreign Key): References `Borrowers.borrower_id`.
- `book_id` (Foreign Key): References `Books.book_id`.
- `loan_date`: Date the book was borrowed.
- `due_date`: Date the book is due to be returned.
- `return_date`: Date the book was actually returned (NULL if not returned).

---

### **Data Population**

- **Books**: 15â€“20 books covering different genres.
- **Authors**: 10â€“15 authors, with some books having multiple authors.
- **Borrowers**: 8â€“12 borrowers with valid contact details.
- **Loans**: Randomly assign books to borrowers with realistic loan and return dates.

---

### **Queries**

1. **Retrieve all books with their authors and publication years.**
2. **Find all books currently on loan (not returned yet).**
3. **List overdue books (past due date but not returned).**
4. **Find the most borrowed books.**
5. **Retrieve borrower details who have overdue books.**
6. **Count the total number of books written by each author.**
7. **Find borrowers who have borrowed more than three books.**
8. **Calculate the average loan duration for returned books.**

---

### **Objectives**

1. Work with **many-to-many relationships** (books and authors).
2. Use **JOINs** efficiently to fetch book-borrower relationships.
3. Apply **aggregate functions** (`COUNT`, `AVG`) and **filters** (`HAVING`, `WHERE`).

Would you like me to prepare the SQL script for **schema creation** first, or should I generate the **sample data**? Let me know how you'd like to proceed! ðŸ˜Š
