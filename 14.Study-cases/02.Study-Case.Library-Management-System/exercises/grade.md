# **Grade: A**

Your work demonstrates excellent understanding and application of SQL concepts, including:

1. **Well-structured Schema Design**:

   - Proper use of relationships, constraints (`CHECK`, `NOT NULL`, `FOREIGN KEY`).
   - Logical organization of the tables and fields.

2. **Thoughtful Sample Data**:

   - Realistic and varied data for all tables.
   - Inclusion of edge cases (e.g., overdue loans, returned books).

3. **Correct Query Logic**:
   - Queries align perfectly with the exercises.
   - Clear use of `JOIN`, `WHERE`, and aggregation functions like `COUNT` to achieve the desired results.

## **Strengths**

- **Attention to Detail**: Your queries are precise and handle edge cases, such as overdue loans and late fees.
- **Use of Constraints**: Effective use of constraints ensures data integrity (e.g., `CHECK`, `UNIQUE`, and `FOREIGN KEY`).
- **Readable SQL**: Clean formatting makes your queries easy to understand and maintain.

### **Suggestions for Improvement**

1. **Enhance Queries for Scalability**:

   - Consider handling edge cases dynamically. For example:
     - In the **late fees query**, you could calculate the total fees for all loans per member instead of listing them individually:
       ```sql
       SELECT
         m.FirstName,
         m.LastName,
         SUM(l.LateFee) AS TotalLateFees
       FROM
         Loans l
       JOIN
         Members m ON m.MembersID = l.MembersID
       WHERE
         l.LateFee IS NOT NULL
       GROUP BY
         m.FirstName, m.LastName;
       ```

2. **Use Descriptive Aliases**:

   - Some queries, like the most popular genres, could use descriptive aliases for improved readability.
     Example:
     ```sql
     SELECT
       g.GenreName AS Genre,
       COUNT(l.LoanID) AS NumberOfLoans
     FROM
       Loans l
     JOIN
       Books b ON l.BookID = b.BookID
     JOIN
       Genres g ON b.Genre = g.GenreID
     GROUP BY
       g.GenreName
     ORDER BY
       NumberOfLoans DESC;
     ```

3. **Error Handling**:

   - Include conditions to handle potential data issues, such as `NULL` values in columns like `ReturnedOn`.

4. **Use Comments for Documentation**:
   - While your queries include comments, adding a brief explanation for each step in the query would improve clarity.

### **Focus Areas for Future Development**

1. **Advanced Query Techniques**:

   - Practice window functions (`ROW_NUMBER`, `RANK`, `PARTITION BY`) to create more dynamic queries.

2. **Optimization**:

   - Experiment with indexes to improve performance for queries that involve joins and groupings.

3. **Dynamic Date Calculations**:
   - Use PostgreSQL functions like `AGE()` or `GENERATED ALWAYS` for fields like `LateFee`.
