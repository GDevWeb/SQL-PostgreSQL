# **Study Case: Inventory and Order Management System**

## **Overview**

You will design a database to manage inventory and orders for an online store. This case focuses on managing products, orders, suppliers, and tracking stock levels.

### **Schema Design**

#### **1. Products**

- `product_id` (Primary Key): Unique identifier.
- `product_name`: Name of the product.
- `category`: Product category.
- `price`: Price per unit.
- `stock_quantity`: Current stock level.

#### **2. Suppliers**

- `supplier_id` (Primary Key): Unique identifier.
- `supplier_name`: Name of the supplier.
- `contact_email`: Email address of the supplier.
- `phone`: Supplier's phone number.

#### **3. Orders**

- `order_id` (Primary Key): Unique identifier.
- `customer_name`: Name of the customer.
- `order_date`: Date the order was placed.
- `status`: Status of the order (e.g., pending, shipped, delivered).

#### **4. OrderDetails**

- `order_detail_id` (Primary Key): Unique identifier.
- `order_id` (Foreign Key): References `Orders.order_id`.
- `product_id` (Foreign Key): References `Products.product_id`.
- `quantity`: Quantity of the product ordered.
- `subtotal`: Computed as `quantity * price`.

#### **5. ProductSuppliers**

- `product_supplier_id` (Primary Key): Unique identifier.
- `product_id` (Foreign Key): References `Products.product_id`.
- `supplier_id` (Foreign Key): References `Suppliers.supplier_id`.

### **Data Population**

- Products: 10â€“15 products with diverse categories and prices.
- Suppliers: 5â€“8 suppliers with realistic contact details.
- Orders: 10â€“15 orders with varied statuses.
- OrderDetails: Randomly assign products to orders.
- ProductSuppliers: Map suppliers to products.

### **Queries**

1. **Retrieve all products with their categories, prices, and stock levels.**
2. **Find all orders placed by a specific customer.**
3. **Calculate the total revenue generated by all orders.**
4. **List all suppliers for a specific product.**
5. **Identify products that need restocking (stock level below a threshold).**
6. **Find the top 5 most-ordered products by quantity.**
7. **Calculate the total value of an order, including all products.**
8. **Get the total number of products supplied by each supplier.**

---

### **Objectives**

1. Practice working with many-to-many relationships (e.g., `ProductSuppliers`).
2. Refine skills in aggregation (`SUM`, `COUNT`) and filtering (`HAVING`, `WHERE`).
3. Use subqueries and joins effectively for complex data retrieval.
