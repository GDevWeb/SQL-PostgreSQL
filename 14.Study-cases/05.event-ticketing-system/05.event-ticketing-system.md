# **Study Case: Event Ticketing System**

---

## **Overview**

Design and implement a database for an **Event Ticketing System**, where users can browse events, book tickets, and manage bookings. This case will introduce concepts like many-to-many relationships and advanced query techniques.

---

### **Schema Design**

#### **1. Users**

- `user_id` (Primary Key): Unique identifier.
- `username`: User's name, unique.
- `email`: Email address, unique.
- `created_at`: Account creation timestamp.

#### **2. Events**

- `event_id` (Primary Key): Unique identifier.
- `event_name`: Name of the event.
- `location`: Location of the event.
- `start_time`: Event start time.
- `end_time`: Event end time.
- `price`: Ticket price.

#### **3. Bookings**

- `booking_id` (Primary Key): Unique identifier.
- `user_id` (Foreign Key): References `Users.user_id`.
- `event_id` (Foreign Key): References `Events.event_id`.
- `tickets`: Number of tickets booked.
- `total_cost`: Computed as `tickets * price`. --create a view
- `booking_time`: Timestamp of booking.

---

### **Data Population**

- Users: 10â€“15 users with realistic names and emails.
- Events: 8â€“10 events with diverse locations and prices.
- Bookings: Randomly assign bookings to users for events.

---

### **Queries**

1. **Retrieve all events with their details (name, location, start time, and ticket price).**
2. **Find all bookings made by a specific user.**
3. **Get the total revenue generated for each event.**
4. **List all users who booked tickets for a specific event.**
5. **Find the most popular event based on the number of tickets sold.**
6. **Calculate the average ticket price for all events.**
7. **Find events with a revenue greater than a specific amount.**

---

### **Objectives**

1. Practice designing and managing many-to-many relationships.
2. Work with **aggregations**, **joins**, and **filters** in queries.
3. Understand the use of computed columns (e.g., `total_cost`).
