### 🚀 **What to Expect in This Section**

This module will give you an overview of what you'll learn in Section 5. Here’s a breakdown of the key concepts and skills you’re likely to cover:

---

### 🛠️ **Core Topics in Data Manipulation & Querying**

1. **CRUD Operations**:

   - **Create**: Adding new data using `INSERT`.
   - **Read**: Retrieving data using `SELECT` with various filters and conditions.
   - **Update**: Modifying existing data using `UPDATE`.
   - **Delete**: Removing data using `DELETE`.

2. **Advanced Querying**:

   - **Filtering Data**: Using `WHERE`, `LIKE`, `BETWEEN`, `IN`, and `NULL` checks.
   - **Sorting Data**: Using `ORDER BY` to sort results.
   - **Limiting Results**: Using `LIMIT` and `OFFSET` to manage large result sets.
   - **Aggregation**: Using functions like `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MAX`, `MIN`.
   - **Grouping Data**: Using `GROUP BY` and filtering with `HAVING`.

3. **Joins**:

   - Combining data from multiple tables using `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`, and `FULL OUTER JOIN`.

4. **Data Validation**:

   - Ensuring data integrity with constraints (`CHECK`, `NOT NULL`, `UNIQUE`).

5. **Subqueries**:
   - Using queries within queries to achieve complex data retrieval.

### 💡 **Goals for This Module**

By the end of Section 5, you should be able to:

1. **Perform CRUD Operations Confidently**:

   - Insert, retrieve, update, and delete records effectively.

2. **Write Complex Queries**:

   - Filter, sort, and aggregate data.
   - Use joins and subqueries to pull data from multiple tables.

3. **Ensure Data Integrity**:
   - Apply constraints and validate data effectively.

### 📝 **How to Approach This Module**

1. **Hands-On Practice**:

   - Follow along with examples and exercises.
   - Apply what you learn to your own databases, like the **bookstore** project.

2. **Take Notes**:

   - Document key SQL commands, syntax, and use cases.

3. **Ask Questions**:

   - If something isn’t clear, don’t hesitate to reach out or review previous sections.

4. **Reflect & Review**:
   - After each lesson, review what you’ve learned and how you can apply it.
